Hi, I'm Vetle Dyngleand

I'm a 14 year old aspiring software developer from Bergen, Norway. I have been coding in c# for about two and half years.
Currently focusing on learning game development with unity and monogame and general c# development.

I plan to learn java, javascript/typescript, C/C++ and Rust in the future, though focusing on learning c# software development and blazor web development first.

I'm not working on any large personal projects currently, since i enjoy working on projects for no more than a few weeks max.
